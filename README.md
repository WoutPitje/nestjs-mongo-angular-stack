# [yourappname]

Welcome to the `[yourappname]` project, a comprehensive solution developed by `[YourOwner]`. This application utilizes NestJS for the backend, Angular for the frontend, and Svelte for the website, all containerized using Docker. This README outlines the process to set up and run the development environment using Docker Compose.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your development environment using Docker. This approach ensures that all dependencies and services are correctly configured and isolated.

### Prerequisites

- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installation and Running

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[youronwer]/[yourappname].git
   cd [yourappname]
2. Start the development environment:
   ./dev.sh

This script will use docker-compose to build and start all the necessary containers for the backend, frontend, and any associated services. You can access the application as specified in the output of the docker-compose logs.

The website will be available at appname.localhost
