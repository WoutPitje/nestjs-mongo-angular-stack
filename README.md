# [yourappname]

Welcome to the `[yourappname]` project, a comprehensive solution developed by `[YourOwner]`. This application utilizes NestJS for the backend, Angular for the frontend, and Svelte for additional features, all containerized using Docker. This README outlines the process to set up and run the development environment using Docker Compose.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your development environment using Docker. This approach ensures that all dependencies and services are correctly configured and isolated.

### Prerequisites

The only prerequisite is Docker:
- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) if it is not included in your Docker installation.

### Installation and Running

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[youronwer]/[yourappname].git
   cd [yourappname]
2. Start the development environment:
   ./dev.sh

This script will use docker-compose to build and start all the necessary containers for the backend, frontend, and any associated services. You can access the application as specified in the output of the docker-compose logs.

## Development
Frontend: The Angular and/or Svelte apps are accessible at the designated ports provided in the Docker Compose configuration.
## Backend: The NestJS API will be available as configured in the Docker setup.
Make sure to refer to the individual README.md files in the respective directories for specific details about each component of the stack.
